= Gitup-py
Gitup in python.
This is for us working with the cmd.exe (not the Git Bash).

== How to use it
=== Windows
First, clone:
git clone git://github.com/eriik/gitup-py.git

Then you've gotta know what path you're using:
cd gitup-py
echo %cd%

Add this path to the "enviroment variable path" by right clicking "Computer" -> "Properties" -> "Advanced System Settings" -> Tab "Advanced" -> "Enviroment Variables..."
Scroll down in the System variables to "Path", select it and choose "Edit". Go to the last character, add a semicolon and then your path. Should look something like this: "[...]Program Files\Mercurial\;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Temp\gitup-py"
